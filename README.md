# StatTalk
This is a repository for discussing Psych Statistics Pedagogy at Brooklyn College.

## Background

Several Psych faculty that teach PSYC 3400 (Stats) will be participating in an online 25 week course by the Association of College and University Educators (ACUE), on "Effective Teaching Practices". The course will "prepare faculty in evidence-based teaching practices proven through independently-validated research to improve student achievement and close equity gaps. Faculty who complete the program earn a nationally recognized Certificate in Effective College Instruction, the only college teaching credential endorsed by the American Council on Education (ACE). The course also provides an opportunity to build communities of pedagogical practice with colleagues at Brooklyn College."

## Purpose

This is an opportuntiy to "build communities of pedagogical practice"...and this repository is intended support this community building. Specifically, when I (Matt) signed up for this course, my intention for the future was to use a blog to reflect on course material (from the ACUE course) each week. This space can be used for that purpose, and more. So, I am inviting my colleagues to use this space to engage in conversations and reflections as they take the course (starting in September). It is possible that conversation could start at any time before the course.

## How to use this space.

Although this repository can be expanded to support many kinds of documents, I will suggest we begin conversations in the "issues" tab. This enables threaded conversations. You can create a new issue, or respond to an existing issue. If we think an issue has been discussed enough, we can close the issue (and that record of conversation will be saved). Currently, this repository is set to public. It is possible to create a private repository, however I am interested in public conversations so my preference would be to keep it public-facing.

I believe you may need to create a free github account in order to comment in the issues tab.
